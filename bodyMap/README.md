# bodyMap
Interactive body map, with multi selection. 
This is a tutorial, of how to create a body map, from scratch.
The point of this project is the lack of information I encountered to create something similar. Credit to http://www.humananatomyillustrations.com/interactive-human-anatomy-front-back.html I have used their logic in order to create mine.

## Getting Started & Prerequisites

There is no need to any other software, yet you need to select your picture from the web or use one of your own and access to https://www.image-map.net/ 



### Running

No further installation required to run the files in this repo. Just clone or download, and run index.html in any browser.


## Custom version tutorial

* You will need first to decide on your image
* Decide how to create areas for your picture map, within the html5 map tag. 

```
https://www.image-map.net/
* Upload you picture 
* Select your shape and decide your coordinate on the picture.
* Once you are done with the areas, click "Show me the code"
* MAKE SURE TO GIVE EVERY AREA an ID

```
* Use http://www.outsharked.com/imagemapster/default.aspx?docs.html to read about your intialisation and data binding of map and picture.
